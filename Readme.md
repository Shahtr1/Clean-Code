# Software Development Principles and Practices: An Elaborate Guide

## Introduction

This README dives deep into various software development principles, practices, and paradigms. It aims to offer clarity
and context to each concept, ensuring both novices and seasoned developers can benefit from it.

## Principles

### Testing

**Purpose**: Testing is foundational to producing reliable software. Through testing, we ensure the software behaves as
expected under different scenarios, leading to better user trust and less unexpected issues.

- **Surrounding Code with Tests**: Rather than making mere claims about code's correctness, it's essential to
  demonstrate its reliability through tests.
- **Use of Try Blocks**: Encapsulating error-prone code within `try` blocks helps handle errors gracefully. Keeping
  each `try` block in separate functions improves code readability and maintenance.
- **Avoid Nested Try-Catch**: Nested `try-catch` blocks can make code more complicated, leading to harder maintenance
  and potential issues.
- **Error Handling**: Using exceptions over error return codes offers clearer and more maintainable error handling.

### Code Quality

**Why Code Quality Matters**: High-quality code is easier to maintain, understand, and extend. It ensures software
longevity and minimizes technical debt.

- **Command and Query Separation**:
    - Functions that return values, or "queries", should be free from side effects. This makes their behavior
      predictable.
    - Functions that don't return values, or "commands", carry out tasks and thus may have side effects.
- **Open-Closed Principle**: Designing modules to be extendable (open to extension) but not modifiable (closed to
  modification) ensures stability while allowing growth. Using base classes and derivatives aids in achieving this.
- **Code Organization**: Grouping functions that operate on the same set of variables into classes fosters encapsulation
  and organization.
- **Code Clarity**: Aim for clear, concise code. Ensure that any reader can understand its function without excessive
  comments. Avoid ambiguous code that may cause "double-take" moments for readers.
- **File Size Considerations**: While the file size isn't necessarily an indicator of code quality, keeping files
  concise (ideally under 150 lines) can make them easier to navigate and maintain.

### Developer Fundamentals

**Software Basics**: At its core, software development revolves around three primary actions: Sequence, Selection, and
Iteration.

- **Sequence**: Refers to the order in which instructions are processed.
- **Selection**: Determines the paths a program might take during execution.
- **Iteration**: Covers the repetitive execution of specific code sections. Two main types:
    - **Count-Controlled Iteration**: Repeats based on a predetermined count.
    - **Condition-Controlled Iteration**: Repeats as long as a condition remains true.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**The Power of TDD**: TDD is a disciplined approach to coding, ensuring that tests drive the design and development
process, leading to robust and reliable software.

- **Progressive Enhancement**: In TDD, the codebase grows incrementally. Start by writing a test for a feature. Only
  then write enough code to satisfy that test.
- **Code Evolution**: Production code should generalize over time, while tests remain specific. This contrast ensures
  flexibility in the software and specificity in its expected behavior.

## Agile and SCRUM

### Agile

**The Agile Mindset**: Agile is a framework for adaptive, iterative software development that prioritizes collaboration
and customer feedback.

- **Project Management**: Projects are divided into time-boxed iterations. Performance in these iterations provides data
  to adjust strategies and timelines.
- **Relative Estimations**: Rather than attempting precise predictions, Agile teams use relative estimates, gauging new
  tasks against known reference tasks.

### SCRUM

**SCRUM's Focus**: While an Agile methodology, SCRUM specifically emphasizes the business-facing processes of software
development.

- **Planning Game**: At SCRUM's heart is the planning game, where tasks are prioritized and assigned for upcoming
  sprints.
- **Engineering Practices**: It's crucial to pair SCRUM with solid engineering practices. Without these, SCRUM's
  efficiency diminishes over time.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Addressing Non-Functional Requirements**: Quantify them. For instance, instead of vaguely wanting a "fast" system,
  specify a need like "handling 10,000 transactions per second."
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Avoid delving into technical jargon like "refactoring" with non-technical stakeholders.
  Focus on deliverables and value.

## Conclusion

This guide offers a comprehensive look at essential software development principles and practices. While it lays a solid
foundation, the journey to mastery in software development is continuous, with learning and practice at its core.
